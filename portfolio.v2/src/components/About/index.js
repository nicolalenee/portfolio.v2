          <p>Hey there!</p>
          <p>My name's Nicola and I am a budding full stack web developer!</p>
          <p>I began my journey into web development in 2020 after toying around with the <a href="https://notion-enhancer.github.io/">Notion Enhancer</a> extension. The experience was so exciting that I felt compelled to keep going with it. While I had some brief knowleddge of HTML and CSS, I began to dive deeper into development on my own. Finally, I decided to take a more involved approach and enrolled myself in a coding bootcamp at Butler University, with a focus on the MERN stack. As of May 3rd, I have graduated the course and am currently in pursuit of new career opportunities and absorbing even more information!</p>
          <p>I've recently relocated to Virginia and spend my free time playing video games, building mechanical keyboards, and reading. ðŸ‘¾</p>
          <h3>Brand Statement</h3>
          <p><i>Full stack web developer equipped with a psychology background and strong interpersonal skills to best understand user needs and create intuitive web applications. Recently awarded a certificate in full stack development from Butler Universityâ€™s Executive Education program harnessing new knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL and nonSQL databases. Acknowledged as intuitive and enthusiastic with passion about developing creative apps, with a focal point on mobile-first design and efficient user experience. I utilized strong interpersonal skills and agile project management in previous group projects. In a recent group project, I worked on a team of four to develop an application with the MVC paradigm that allows musical artists and venues to seek out other artists or help needed in scheduling live performances. Iâ€™m thrilled to employ my skills as a part of an inventive, ever-evolving team to build impressive user-focused web applications. </i></p>
